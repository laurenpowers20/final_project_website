                    <h5>Paris</h5>
                    <p>Paris - the City of Light - has been a beacon of culture for centuries. As a world capital of art, fashion, food, literature, and ideas, it stands as a symbol of all the fine things human civilization can offer. Paris offers sweeping boulevards, chatty crepe stands, chic boutiques, and world-class art galleries. Sip decaf with deconstructionists at a sidewalk cafe, then step into an Impressionist painting in a tree-lined park. Climb Notre-Dame and rub shoulders with the gargoyles. Cruise the Seine, zip to the top of the Eiffel Tower, and saunter down Avenue des Champs-Elysees. Master the Louvre and Orsay museums. Save some after-dark energy for one of the world's most romantic cities.</p>

                    <h5>Mont St. Michel</h5>
                    <p>The island has held strategic fortifications since ancient times and since the 8th century AD has been the seat of the monastery from which it draws its name. The structural composition of the town exemplifies the feudal society that constructed it: on top, God, the abbey and monastery; below, the great halls; then stores and housing; and at the bottom, outside the walls, houses for fishermen and farmers.</p>

                    <p>The Savoie region grows Europe's highest mountains and is the penthouse of the French Alps, with drop-dead spectacular scenery. More than just a pretty-peaked face, stubborn Savoie maintained its independence from France until 1860, when mountains became targets, rather than obstacles, for travelers. Today's Savoie is France's mountain-sports capital, featuring 15,771-foot Mont Blanc as its centerpiece. Boasting wood chalets overflowing with geraniums and cheese fondue in every restaurant, Savoie feels more Swiss than French.</p>

                    <h5>Madrid</h5>
                    <p>Dive headlong into the grandeur and intimate charm of Madrid. Feel the vibe in Puerta del Sol, the pulsing heart of modern Madrid and of Spain itself. The lavish Royal Palace, with its gilded rooms and frescoed ceilings, rivals Versailles. The Prado has Europe's top collection of paintings, and nearby hangs Picasso's chilling masterpiece, Guernica. Retiro Park invites you to take a shady siesta and hopscotch through a mosaic of lovers, families, skateboarders, pets walking their masters, and expert bench-sitters. Save time for Madrid's elegant shops and people-friendly pedestrian zones. On Sundays, cheer for the bull at a bullfight or bargain like mad at a mega-size flea market. Swelter through the hot, hot summers or bundle up for the cold, dry winters. Save some energy for after dark, when Madrilenos pack the streets for an evening paseo that can continue past midnight. Lively Madrid has enough street-singing, bar-hopping, and people-watching vitality to give any visitor a boost of youth</p>

It houses a fine collection of art and sits amongst beautifully planted grounds that are open to visitors.</p>

                    <p>The Dali Museum is very entertaining and no one is really prepared for it because it is so very different. Dali designed it in the last years of his life, designing every little detail. The outside walls have small sculptures of bread buns. On top of the museum you see golden mannequins and giant eggs.</p>

                    <h5>Cinque Terre</h5>
                    <p>Along a beautifully isolated six-mile stretch of the most seductive corner of the Italian Riviera lie the Cinque Terre - five (cinque) small, traffic-free towns gently and steadily carving a good life out of difficult terrain. Each village fills a ravine with a lazy hive of human activity - calloused locals and sunburned travelers enjoying the area's unique mix of Italian culture and nature. There's not a Fiat or museum in sight - just sun, sea, sand (well, pebbles), wine, and pure, unadulterated Italy. Enjoy the villages, swimming, hiking, and evening romance of one of God's great gifts to tourism. While the Cinque Terre are now discovered (and can be unpleasantly crowded midday, when tourist boats and cruise-ship excursions drop by), I've never seen happier, more relaxed tourists.</p>

                    <h5>Siena</h5>
                    <p>Situated atop three hills, Siena qualifies as Italy's ultimate "hill town." Its thriving historic center, with red-brick lanes cascading every which way, offers Italy's best medieval city experience. For those who dream of a Fiat-free Italy, Siena is a haven. Pedestrians rule in the old center of town, as the only drivers allowed are residents and cabbies. Sit at a cafe on the main square. Wander narrow streets lined with colorful flags and studded with iron rings to tether horses. While nearby Florence has the blockbuster museums, Siena has an easy-to-enjoy soul: Courtyards sport flower-decked wells, alleys dead-end at rooftop views, and the sky is a rich blue dome.</p>

                    <h5>Sorrento</h5>
                    <p>Wedged on a ledge under the mountains and over the Mediterranean, spritzed by lemon and olive groves, Sorrento is an attractive resort of 20,000 residents and, in summer, just as many tourists. It's as well-located for regional sightseeing as it is a fine place to stay and stroll. The Sorrentines have gone out of their way to create a completely safe and relaxed place for tourists to come and spend money. As 90 percent of the town's economy is tourism, everyone seems to speak fluent English and work for the Chamber of Commerce. This gateway to the Amalfi Coast has an unspoiled old quarter, a lively shopping street, and a spectacular cliffside setting.</p>

                    <h5>Santorini</h5>
                    <p>Santorini is one of the Mediterranean's most dramatic islands: a flooded caldera (a collapsed volcanic crater) with a long, steep, multicolored arc of cliffs, thrusting up a thousand feet above sea level. Sometimes called "The Devil's Isle," this unique place has captured visitors' imaginations for millennia and might have inspired the tales of Atlantis. But the otherworldly appeal of Santorini doesn't end with its setting. Perched along the ridgeline is a gaggle of perfectly placed whitewashed villages, punctuated with azure domes, that make this, undeniably, one of Greece's most scenic spots. If this place didn't exist, some brilliant fantasy painter would have to conjure it up.</p>

                    <h5>Olympia</h5>
                    <p>A visit to Olympia - most famous as the site of the original Olympic Games - offers one of your best opportunities for a hands-on antiquity experience. Line up at the original starting line in the 2,500-year-old Olympic Stadium. Visit the Temple of Zeus, former site of a gigantic statue of Zeus that was one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. Ponder the temple's once-majestic columns - toppled like towers of checkers by an earthquake — which are as evocative as anything from ancient times. Take a close look at the Archaeological Museum's gold-medal-quality statues and artifacts. And don't forget to step back and enjoy the setting itself. Despite the crowds that pour through here, Olympia remains a magical place, with ruins nestled among lush, shady groves of pine trees.</p>
